# ReactJS Reddit Posts App

## About

- This is a simple React app that shows the latest posts from the **r/reactjs** subreddit.
- It uses the Reddit API to fetch data and display it in a clean card layout.
- Each card shows the post title, score, content, and a link to view it on Reddit.
- The design uses a modern gradient background and glass-effect cards.
